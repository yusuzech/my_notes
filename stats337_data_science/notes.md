## What is data science

There is a gap between the data science concept and what business actually need. Not every "data scientist" are going to do machine learning stuff. Most of the times, what the business need are just some simple methods that solves the problem.

data science/ analysis includes **five high level tasks**: discovery,wrangling, profiling, modeling and reporting.



Analyst Archetype:



* Hackers： I’m not a DBA, but I’m good at SQL. I’m not a programmer
  but am good at programming. I’m not a statistician but I
  am good at applying statistical techniques.
* Scripters：They were able to perform simple manipulations
  such as filtering and aggregating data, but typically could not perform
  custom operations such as parsing log files or scraping data off the
  web. Scripters applied the most sophisticated models among the analysts
  we observed.
* Application Users: All data is in a relational database. When I get it, it’s out
  of the database and into an Excel format that I can start
  pivoting. I ask the IT team to pull it.



A generalist is more valuable than a specialist.
